## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am not the best at css and design in general so this project is to help with that. I'll probably end up redoing it down the line to be generally better but this is how it is right now. Thoughts and suggestions are welcome!
